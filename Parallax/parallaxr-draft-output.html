<h4><span style="color:#28527A"> What is it? </span></h4>

<hr/>

<p><font size="+1"> Right off of the coast of California is the region of the ocean known as the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). The CCE is the area of the ocean highlighted in <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>Fig. 1</strong> </span> stretching  about 1900 miles vertically from <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>southern British Columbia to Baja California.</strong> </span> </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> California&#39;s commercial and recreational fishing activity was responsible for nearly $25 billion in economic activity and the creation of 142,000 jobs in 2016, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> A significant characteristic fueling the productivity in this region is that <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>the CCE is one of the four upwelling driven ecosystems</strong> </span> in the world. </font></p>

<p><font size="+2"> <em>Noun:</em> <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>A natural phenomena whereby seasonal winds in spring and summer cause surface waters to flow offshore, making room for cooler, deeper waters to rise near the coast.</strong> </span></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> Coastal upwelling is the process by which strong winds from the north and northwest blow down the coast of California and, due to the Earth&#39;s rotation, cause the surface waters to flow offshore. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> <strong>Water from deeper in the ocean replaces the offshore-flowing surface waters.</strong> </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> This is significant because deeper waters are <strong>colder</strong> and <strong>contain more nutrients</strong> due to the collection of decomposing organic sediment. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> These nutrients <strong>fuel life in the ecosystem from the bottom up</strong>, supporting the smallest microbes and phytoplankton as well as all sorts of fish and predators, leading to the large populations of marine mammals, seabirds, and fisheries in the region. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p><font size="+1"> This same process that drives much of the productivity off the coast of California also makes the ecosystem uniquely vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of climate change.

<hr/>

<p><font size="+1"> CalCOFI conducts quarterly research cruises off the southern and central California coast to collect a <a href="https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;">vast range of physical, chemical, and biological data</a>; weather, bird, and marine mammal observation, seawater collection and analysis, biological sample collection using various nets, and more. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> While some of these measurements are collected continuously over the duration of each cruise, a majority of the data is recorded at <a href="https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/station-positions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> distinct sampling station points</a>.</p>

<p><font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>Fig. 3</strong> </span> displays the core region where CalCOFI samples, known as CalCOFI&#39;s core sampling station grid. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> This core grid spans the waters in and beyond the Southern California Bight, the curved section of the CA coastline from Point Conception south to San Diego. The Bight creates a large, productive open bay with diverse seafloor habitats and marine life, and is also the most densely populated region of the CA coast. </font></p>

<hr/>

<p><font size="+1">Oxygen is critical to the health of the ocean and is a fundamental requirement for marine life. Nearly all multicellular marine organisms and many microbes depend on the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the ocean the same way we depend on oxygen in the air.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Sources of oxygen in the ocean include the oxygen that diffuses in from the atmosphere at the surface and the oxygen produced by photosynthesis in the upper, sunlight-filled waters. Oxygen from these upper layers is then transported to deeper layers through vertical mixing.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Oxygen is consumed by organisms during respiration, by the decomposition of organic matter, and absorption into oxides and carbon compounds.</font></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><font size="+1">When a region of the ocean is deprived of adequate DO such that the physiological and ecological processes of the marine ecosystem are impaired, the state of low oxygen is called <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>hypoxia</strong> </span> and the region is called a hypoxic zone. </font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>Hypoxia occurs when the rate of oxygen consumption in a region exceeds the rate at which oxygen is replenished.</strong> Climate warming disrupts the balance between these two processes and has been worsening de-oxygenation in the CCE.</span> </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>Fig. 4</strong> </span> displays how various physical processes affect dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean. Climate change affects these processes, as highlighted by the green text, leading to the expansion of hypoxic zones throughout the deeper waters of the CCE. </font></p>

<hr/>

<p><font size="+1">As mentioned earlier, the deeper waters that are upwelled during spring and summer are poor in oxygen. The primary cause of seasonal low-oxygen surface waters is this upwelling.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The upwelled waters are also rich in nutrients. These nutrients increase ecosystem productivity by fueling phytoplankton algal blooms that support large populations of consumers, with the effects rippling throughout the food web.</font> </p>

<p><font size="+1">During these productive seasons, respiratory demand for oxygen is increased, furthering de-oxygenation. Furthermore, climate change is hypothesized to intensify upwelling, which would increase the risk of hypoxia throughout the CCE.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Analysis of CalCOFI&#39;s data reflects lower oxygen levels during the upwelling seasons.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The heatmap in <span style="color:#28527A"><strong>Fig. 5</strong></span> displays the average dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper 300 meters of seawater, aggregated over all the core on-shelf stations that were sampled at the time, for each quarter since 1949.

<hr/>

<p><font size="+1"> In addition to the seasonal variation in oxygen levels caused by upwelling, the CCE is affected by systems of natural multi-decadal climate variation patterns such as the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/weather-atmosphere/el-nino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> <strong>El Ni&#241;o Southern Oscillation</strong></a> (ENSO, ~2-7 year long cycle). </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> ENSO has positive and negative phases that affect sea surface temperatures, atmospheric conditions, upwelling strength, and more. Positive ENSO phases lead to <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>El Ni&#241;o events with warmer conditions, weaker upwelling, higher oxygen levels, and lower nutrient concentrations.</strong> </span> Negative ENSO phases lead to La Ni&#241;a events with the opposite conditions. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> The index used to track how ENSO phases affect sea surface temperatures in the ocean is called the <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-variability-oceanic-niño-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;">Oceanic Ni&#241;o Index (ONI)</a>. Positive ONI values indicate El Ni&#241;o and negative ONI values indicate La Ni&#241;a. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> <strong>Fig. 6</strong> displays a time series graph of the average dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper 300 meters of seawater, aggregated over all the core on-shelf stations sampled in a given year, since 1949. The yellow lines highlight years with strong El Ni&#241;o events, where the ONI exceeded 1.5. <a href="https://rpubs.com/aradams11/966282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Click here to open the plot in a new tab</strong></a> for closer examination of the exact oxygen values.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> It is evident that, overall, the annual average oxygen level on the continental shelf of the Southern California Bight varies a lot from year to year. We can also see that the <span style="color:#28527A"><strong>strong El Ni&#241;o events correspond with local maximums in oxygen levels in the graph</strong></span>, reflecting how climate events impact dissolved oxygen concentration. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> Anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is an additional agent affecting oxygen levels, layered on top of all the natural drivers of oxygen&#39;s variability we have highlighted here. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> Thus, <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>teasing apart anthropogenic declines in oxygen from natural variation patterns requires sampling consistency and longer ranges of time series data on oxygen in the coming decades.</strong> </span> </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> Climate projection models predict that the impact of anthropogenic warming will increasingly dominate natural variation patterns throughout the twenty-first century. Because of this, <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>CalCOFI&#39;s continued monitoring of the ocean will be essential to understanding and predicting impacts on marine life and fisheries.</strong> </span> </font></p>

<p>The oxygen data employed in this project is from <strong>CalCOFI&#39;s bottle database</strong>, publicly available alongside multiple <a href="https://calcofi.org/data/" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> other datasets here.</a>  </p>

<p>The bottle database contains oceanographic data - including temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, nutrients, and more - measured from seawater samples that are collected at CalCOFI stations. Seawater samples are collected by lowering a rosette of bottles, shown in <span style="color:#28527A"><strong>Fig. 7</strong></span> into the water. The bottles collect seawater at many distinct depths: from the surface, down to over 5000 meters deep.</p>

<p>The graphs above utilized data from the upper 300 meters of samples, collected from the core transect lines (76.7 to 93.3), at on shelf stations (stations numbers &#x2264; 60).</p>
