<font size="+1"> Anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is an additional agent affecting oxygen levels, layered on top of all the natural drivers of oxygen's variability we have highlighted here. </font>

<font size="+1"> Thus, <span style="color:#28527A"> **teasing apart anthropogenic declines in oxygen from natural variation patterns requires sampling consistency and longer ranges of time series data on oxygen in the coming decades.** </span> </font>

<font size="+1"> Climate projection models predict that the impact of anthropogenic warming will increasingly dominate natural variation patterns throughout the twenty-first century. Because of this, <span style="color:#28527A"> **CalCOFI's continued monitoring of the ocean will be essential to understanding and predicting impacts on marine life and fisheries.** </span> </font>

<font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> **We hope that this page has helped you learn more about the ocean off the coast of California; how oxygen levels vary naturally due to upwelling, marine ecosystem respiratory demands, climate oscillation events; how climate change affects this variability and exacerbates the risk of hypoxia; and how crucial CalCOFI's monitoring work is in the face of these changing ocean conditions.** </span> Thanks for scrolling along with us! :) </font>

<font size="+1"> It is important to note, given how dynamic oxygen levels are in the ocean, that aggregation of oxygen data over time, location, and depth, while useful for conveying high level trends, inevitably loses a lot of the nuance in oxygen's variability. Since the graphs in <a href="https://rpubs.com/aradams11/966281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;">Fig. 5</a> and <a href="https://rpubs.com/aradams11/966282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;">Fig. 6</a> display aggregated summaries of oxygen concentration, we encourage folks who are interested in exploring more of oxygen's spatial and temporal variability to take a look at <a href="https://calcofi.io" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> CalCOFI's other data products</a>.
