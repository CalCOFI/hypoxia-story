#### <span style="color:#28527A">About the Data</span>

The oxygen data employed in this project is from **CalCOFI's bottle database**, publicly available alongside multiple <a href="https://calcofi.org/data/" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> other datasets here.</a>  

The bottle database contains oceanographic data - including temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, nutrients, and more - measured from seawater samples that are collected at CalCOFI stations. Seawater samples are collected by lowering a rosette of bottles, shown in <span style="color:#28527A">**Fig. 7**</span> into the water. The bottles collect seawater at many distinct depths: from the surface, down to over 5000 meters deep.

The graphs above utilized data from the upper 300 meters of samples, collected from the core transect lines (76.7 to 93.3), at on shelf stations (stations numbers &#x2264; 60).

The code for this project can be found here. [will add link]
