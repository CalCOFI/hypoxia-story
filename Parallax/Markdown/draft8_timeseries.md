## <span style="color:#28527A"> How does oxygen vary across years off the coast of California? </span>

---

<font size="+1"> In addition to the seasonal variation in oxygen levels caused by upwelling, the CCE is affected by systems of natural multi-decadal climate variation patterns such as the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/weather-atmosphere/el-nino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> **El Ni&#241;o Southern Oscillation**</a> (ENSO, ~2-7 year long cycle). </font>

<font size="+1"> ENSO has positive and negative phases that affect sea surface temperatures, atmospheric conditions, upwelling strength, and more. Positive ENSO phases lead to <span style="color:#28527A"> **El Ni&#241;o events with warmer conditions, weaker upwelling, higher oxygen levels, and lower nutrient concentrations.** </span> Negative ENSO phases lead to La Ni&#241;a events with the opposite conditions. </font>

<font size="+1"> The index used to track how ENSO phases affect sea surface temperatures in the ocean is called the <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-variability-oceanic-niño-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;">Oceanic Ni&#241;o Index (ONI)</a>. Positive ONI values indicate El Ni&#241;o and negative ONI values indicate La Ni&#241;a. </font>

<font size="+1"> <a href="https://rpubs.com/aradams11/966282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;">**Fig. 6**</a> displays a time series graph of the average dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper 300 meters of seawater, aggregated over all the core on-shelf stations sampled in a given year, since 1949. The yellow lines highlight years with strong El Ni&#241;o events, where the ONI exceeded 1.5. </font>

<font size="+1"> It is evident that, overall, the annual average oxygen level on the continental shelf of the Southern California Bight varies a lot from year to year. We can also see that the <span style="color:#28527A">**strong El Ni&#241;o events correspond with local maximums in oxygen levels in the graph**</span>, reflecting how climate events impact dissolved oxygen concentration. </font>
