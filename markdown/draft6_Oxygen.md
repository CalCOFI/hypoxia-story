<font size="+1">Oxygen is critical to the health of the ocean and is a fundamental requirement for marine life. Nearly all multicellular marine organisms and many microbes depend on the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the ocean the same way we depend on oxygen in the air.</font>

<font size="+1">Sources of oxygen in the ocean include the oxygen that diffuses in from the atmosphere at the surface and the oxygen produced by photosynthesis in the upper, sunlight-filled waters. Oxygen from these upper layers is then transported to deeper layers through vertical mixing.</font>

<font size="+1">Oxygen is consumed by organisms during respiration, by the decomposition of organic matter, and absorption into oxides and carbon compounds.</font>

<br />

<font size="+1">When a region of the ocean is deprived of adequate DO such that the physiological and ecological processes of the marine ecosystem are impaired, the state of low oxygen is called <span style="color:#28527A"> **hypoxia** </span> and the region is called a hypoxic zone. </font>

> <font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> **Hypoxia occurs when the rate of oxygen consumption in a region exceeds the rate at which oxygen is replenished.** Climate warming disrupts the balance between these two processes and has been worsening de-oxygenation in the CCE.</span> </font>

<font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> **Fig. 4** </span> displays how various physical processes affect dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean. Climate change affects these processes, as highlighted by the green text, leading to the expansion of hypoxic zones throughout the deeper waters of the CCE. </font>
