## <span style="color:#28527A"> How does oxygen vary seasonally off the coast of California? </span>

---

<font size="+1">As mentioned earlier, the deeper waters that are upwelled during spring and summer are poor in oxygen. The primary cause of seasonal low-oxygen surface waters is this upwelling.</font>

<font size="+1">The upwelled waters are also rich in nutrients. These nutrients increase ecosystem productivity by fueling phytoplankton algal blooms that support large populations of consumers, with the effects rippling throughout the food web.</font> 

<font size="+1">During these productive seasons, respiratory demand for oxygen is increased, furthering de-oxygenation. Furthermore, climate change is hypothesized to intensify upwelling, which would increase the risk of hypoxia throughout the CCE.</font>

<font size="+1">Analysis of CalCOFI's data reflects lower oxygen levels during the upwelling seasons.</font>

<font size="+1">The heatmap in <span style="color:#28527A">**Fig. 5**</span> displays the average dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper 300 meters of seawater, aggregated over all the core on-shelf stations that were sampled at the time, for each quarter since 1949. The yellow stripes correspond to lower levels of DO while the blue stripes indicate higher levels of DO. Gray stripes indicate quarters in which less than 3 core on-shelf stations were sampled. <a href="https://rpubs.com/aradams11/966281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;">**Click here to open the plot in a new tab**</a> and hover over with your cursor to see the exact average oxygen concentration and the number of seawater samples that were analyzed for a given quarter.</font>

<font size="+1">It is evident that <span style="color:#28527A">**spring and summer have lower oxygen levels on average when compared to winter and fall.**</span></font>
