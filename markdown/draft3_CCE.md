#### <span style="color:#28527A"> What is it? </span>

--- 

<font size="+1"> Right off of the coast of California is the region of the ocean known as the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). The CCE is the area of the ocean highlighted in <span style="color:#28527A"> **Fig. 1** </span> stretching  about 1900 miles vertically from <span style="color:#28527A"> **southern British Columbia to Baja California.** </span> </font>

<font size="+1"> California's commercial and recreational fishing activity was responsible for nearly $25 billion in economic activity and the creation of 142,000 jobs in 2016, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. </font>

<font size="+1"> A significant characteristic fueling the productivity in this region is that <span style="color:#28527A"> **the CCE is one of the four upwelling driven ecosystems** </span> in the world. </font>
