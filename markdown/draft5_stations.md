## <span style="color:#28527A"> How does CalCOFI sample off the coast of California? </span>

--- 

<font size="+1"> CalCOFI conducts quarterly research cruises off the southern and central California coast to collect a <a href="https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;">vast range of physical, chemical, and biological data</a>; weather, bird, and marine mammal observation, seawater collection and analysis, biological sample collection using various nets, and more. </font>

<font size="+1"> While some of these measurements are collected continuously over the duration of each cruise, a majority of the data is recorded at <a href="https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/station-positions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> distinct sampling station points</a>.

<font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> **Fig. 3** </span> displays the core region where CalCOFI samples, known as CalCOFI's core sampling station grid. </font>

<font size="+1"> This core grid spans the waters in and beyond the Southern California Bight, the curved section of the CA coastline from Point Conception south to San Diego. The Bight creates a large, productive open bay with diverse seafloor habitats and marine life, and is also the most densely populated region of the CA coast. </font>

<font size="+1"> This page will showcase data collected from the core sampling stations located on the continental shelf. Dissolved oxygen levels are monitored at each of these stations by analyzing seawater samples collected at different depths under each location: from the surface down to over 1000 meters deep. </font>
